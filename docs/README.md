#  Birds of Switzerland

This is the missing app for iOS, which I hoped would have been developed by [Swiss Ornithological Institute (SOI)](https://vogelwarte.ch).
They do have a really nice website where you can lookup bird species found in Switzerland and get more detailed information and photos, but they are missing
an iOS app which makes the same information easily accessible "on the go".  
This is why I started to develop this app in November 2019.

The goal is to provide an app accessing the publicly accessible data of the website. It should allow the user to search through the vast list of birds (by name and category) and show more details.

This app is loading the list of birds, images and sounds from the website https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/birds/birds-of-switzerland/ and caches them locally, 
so the already fetched data can be accessed "on the go".

The app is currently in a closed beta testing state. Please get in touch with [me](mailto:pd95@users.noreply.github.com?subject=Swiss-Birds-App%20beta) if you would like to get an invitation.
