*Birds of Switzerland* is a small directory for on the go.

As parents, you may know the situation when children ask what a beautiful bird is up in the tree and you don't know the answer: "Is it a magpie or a jay?".

With this app you can quickly scroll through the list of Swiss birds and, thanks to the beautiful pictures of the Sempach Ornithological Institute, confirm your suspicion that it is a jay after all.

With this app you have easy access to the data of the Sempach Ornithological Institute (https://www.vogelwarte.ch/voegel/) without having to use a web browser.

The app was developed as an open source project and the source code is freely available. Everyone can contribute with comments, feedback and ideas.

## A new birds App? Why?

*Birds of Switzerland* is the missing iOS app I'd hoped would be provided by the [Swiss Ornithological Institute](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/) along with their very informative website, on which all kinds of bird species that can be found in Switzerland can be looked up, linked to more detailed information and photos.

In order to make this same information accessible on the go I started developing *Birds of Switzerland* in November 2019. 

*Birds of Switzerland* allows the user to find birds by searching through the vast list by name or one of several categories. While used with a network connection, *Birds of Switzerland* loads the requested list of birds, images and sounds from the Swiss Ornithological Institute's website [https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/birds/birds-of-switzerland/](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/birds/birds-of-switzerland/) and caches the data locally in order to keep already accessed data available on the go. Data is not preloaded but accessed data is cached.
