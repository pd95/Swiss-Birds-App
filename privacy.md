# Privacy Policy

There is not much to write here. As an open source project, the source code of the app is publicly accessible and I do not have any commercial interests.

This app is **not collecting any information** on you, your device or your behaviour.
It **does not contain extensions** from third parties (like Google, Facebook) and relies fully on system libraries provided by Apple.

As the app accesses the internet solely to fetch data from [https://vogelwarte.ch](https://vogelwarte.ch), it is possible and also probable that the server (operated by the Swiss Ornithological Institute) is collecting standard access information similar to one shown below:

| IP Address | Date / Time | Access details | Status / Size | App Name / OS version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 31.165.70.218 | 2020/07/15 14:19:06 +0200 | GET /elements/.../vds-filternames-en.json HTTP/1.0 | 200 26262 | Swiss-Birds/11 CFNetwork/1126 Darwin/19.5.0 |

These logs are not personally identifiable and you are not exposing yourself more than browsing the website directly.
