# Privacy Policy

There is not much to write here. As an open source project, the source code of the app is publicly accessible and I do not have any commercial interests.

The app *Birds of Switzerland* **does not collect any information** on you, your device or your behaviour.
It **does not contain extensions from third parties** (like Google, Facebook) and fully relies on system libraries provided by Apple.

As *Birds of Switzerland* accesses the internet solely to fetch data from [https://vogelwarte.ch](https://vogelwarte.ch), it is possible and also probable that the server (operated by the Swiss Ornithological Institute) collects standard access information similar to one shown below:

- IP address, e.g. **31.165.70.218**
- Date / Time, e.g. **2020/07/15 14:19:06 +0200**
- Access details, e.g. **HTTP/1.0 GET /elements/.../vds-filternames-de.json**
- HTTP status / size, e.g. **200 26262**
- App Name / OS version, e.g. **Swiss-Birds/11 CFNetwork/1126 Darwin/19.5.0**

These logs are not personally identifiable and you are not exposing yourself any more than if you were browsing the website directly.
